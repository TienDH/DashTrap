  Dash Trap is a fast-paced pixel arcade where you tap to dash in four directions and keep sliding until you hit a wall. Time your moves to slip past spikes, rotating saws, and moving hazards through compact maze rooms. Quick deaths, instant restarts—always “one more try.”

One-tap controls: easy to learn, hard to master

Dynamic trap patterns that reward timing and planning

Short, high-tempo levels perfect for mobile play

Cohesive pixel art in a bold orange-brown palette
